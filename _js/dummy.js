/*
   I didn't need any JavaScript on the PiHPe website, nor felt like creating 
   an example by moving some of the CSS into a separate file. So that is why
   this file is called dummy.js :-D

   Anyway, you include external scripts and stylesheets in your content 
   sections (see /[pihpe]/_section.php) using:

   links([
      'example.js'
   ]);

   After defining 'example.js' in /[pihpe]/paths/php:
   'example.js' => '/_js/dummy.js',
