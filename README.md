# PiHPe

Love to play with HTML and CSS, and learn some PHP? PiHPe can help you build simple websites. Here's an [example](https://marcelvark.github.io/) that explains what it does, and how to use it. All files used are in the repository.

You'll need to install PHP from [php.net](http://php.net). And you may want to edit `serve.cmd` to start it. But then you're ready to go.

Some additional features are planned for PiHPe:
- improving the build mechanism
- creating a simple template facility
- adding file-relative linking
