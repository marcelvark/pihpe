# pihpe

## What
A bit of PHP to help me create simple websites. It allows me to:

- isolate content in separate files
- have relative paths and links sorted
- publish static versions (i.e. GitHub), too
- use HTML/CSS/JS, with a bit of PHP
- have proper syntax highlighting

## How
For now, most of this info is in the repository files. I will add it here soon...

## First
But first, I'd like to check if my static builds even work on GitHub.
