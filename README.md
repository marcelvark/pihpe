# PiHPe

A bit of PHP to help create simple websites. It's handy if you love to use HTML and CSS, and learn some PHP. Any provider could host your work, but you can also publish a static version on GitHub first. 

Here's such [example](https://marcelvark.github.io/) made with PiHPe. It explains what it does, and how to use it. All files used in the build are in the repository.

You'll need to install PHP from [php.net](http://php.net). And you may want to edit `serve.cmd` to start your version of PHP. But then you're ready to go.

I've still got these features planned for PiHPe:
- improving the build mechanism
- creating a simple template facility
- adding file-relative linking
